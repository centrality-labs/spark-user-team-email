SparkUserTeamEmail provides a simple way for Laravel Spark to allow users to have a different email address on a team, without changing their user email address.

## Use case example
Bob Bobbinson is a user of `spark-developer.com`. Bob uses `bob@bob.com` to log in, but `bob@bob.com` is Bob's personal email and `bob.com` is Bob's personal website.

Bob is a member of two teams on `spark-developer.com`, a team for his personal work (`DevBob`) and one for the company he works for (`BigDevelopsLtd`). Bob has been given a work email to use for all things `BigDevelopsLtd` related. However, out of the box Bob can only have one email - the one used to sign into the site.

Spark User Team Email allows adding secondary email addresses for a user in the context of a team. In this case Bob can add `bob@BigDevelopsLtd.com` as his email for the team `BigDevelopsLtd`.

## Quick Installation

1. Install the package through Composer.

    ```bash
    composer require centrality-labs/spark-user-team-email:dev-master
    ```

1. Add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` file.

    ```php
    CentralityLabs\SparkUserTeamEmail\SparkUserTeamEmailServiceProvider::class,
    ```

1. Publish the configuration, models, and migrations into your project.

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="CentralityLabs\SparkUserTeamEmail\SparkUserTeamEmailServiceProvider"
    ```

    ...
    use CentralityLabs\SparkUserTeamEmail\Traits\HasUserTeamEmail;
    ...

    class User ... {
        ...
        use HasUserTeamEmail;
        ...
    }
    ```

1. You may wish to add the email to the pivot information of the `teams()` relationship:

    ```PHP
        public function teams()
        {
            return $this->sparkTeams()->withPivot(['email', 'role']);
        }
    ```

1. You may wish to add the team emails of a user to your model JSON, do this with:

    ```PHP
    protected $appends = [
        ...
        'teamEmails',
        ...
    ];
    ```
